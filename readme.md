# folklore

a re-telling of [folktale](https://folktale.origamitower.com)

in the early stages, things will change, use at your own `peril`

Currently `Maybe` and `Result` are implemented and reasonably stable. Still, minor version bumps may break things. Use `~` in your `package.json` to avoid breaking changes.

There are some differences from Folktale's API. As an example, hasInstance is a static method on both in pascal case: `HasInstance`. Check the source (or intellisense in your editor). See [#13: A Retelling, not a reimplementation](https://github.com/cassiecascade/folklore/issues/13) for more information about this.
